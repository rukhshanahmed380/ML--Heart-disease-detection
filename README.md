# ML--Heart-disease-detection
A **Machine Learning Heart Disease Detection Model** predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health data. It processes medical parameters like **age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and lifestyle factors** to train an ML model using algorithms like **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks**. The system undergoes **data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training** to improve accuracy. Once trained, users can input their health details to receive an instant prediction. The model can be deployed as a **Django or Flask-based web application**, making it accessible for medical professionals and individuals to assess heart disease risk efficiently.
